# Kickstarting with Excel

## Theater Fever

  As the inspiration for Module 1, Louise is a playwriter who wants to fund her newest $10,000-budget play "Fever" via crowdfunding. That being said, Louise has never done a crowdfunding campaign before, and she doesn't want to jump into it without further research about Kickstarter campaign outcomes. Fortunately, we have data on at least 4,000 Kickstarter projects, and using Microsoft Excel techniques, we will be able to give Louise an idea on how successful kickstarter campaigns for plays are.
